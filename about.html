				about me
			</h3>

			<p>I was born in 1995 in Kalamazoo, Michigan and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1997 where I have lived ever since. Growing up, I played basketball and baseball. I also loved to play all sorts of video games too, just like I do now. One of my favorites was Pokemon Blue, which I played on my now-ancient gameboy color. I happily played that game everyday. One day, my friend showed me the "old man glitch" and I had my first encounter with the notorious Pokemon missingno. It fascinated me, and confused me. After my imagination ran dry, I finally tried to figure out the mystery behind missingno online. I stumbled into a world of "bits" and "variables" and "pointers." I was in the world of programming, and it was then that found my love for computers.</p><br>

			<p>Ever since, I have spent much of my time learning about computers and electronics. I built my first computer as a young teenager, where I installed Ubuntu and got my first taste of Linux. In high school, I learned my first programming language, Java... and now it feels like a second language to me. I have developed a passion for problem solving techniques and understand how technology can interact with it.</p><br>

			<p>In 2014, I began my collegiate career at Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), where I have declared to study Computer Science. I am currently a senior working on my BS, with a minor in Mathematics. In 2018, I plan to enter graduate school to earn my MS in Applied Computer Science.</p><br>

			<p>Computer science offers a wide variety of disciplines; I am mostly interested in networking, cryptography, bitcoin and the evolving crypto-economy, algorithm design, and artificial intelligence. In general, I am interested in the ways we can apply technology to contemporary problems in order to solve them.</p><br>

			<p>Outside of the tech world, I love to cook. <a href="http://www.thebbqguru.net/" target="_blank">I think I got it from my dad!</a> I also love the great outdoors. I have hiked in some of the most beautiful places in the US, and hope to explore international land in the future. One of my favorite hobbies is golfing. Although I'm just a 15 handicap, it's still great fun to hit a ball into the wide open.</p><br>
