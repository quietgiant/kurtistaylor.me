				about me
			</h3>

			<p>I was born in 1995 in Kalamazoo, Michigan and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1997 where I have lived ever since. Growing up, I played basketball and baseball. I also loved to play all sorts of video games too, just like I do now. One of my favorites was Pokemon Blue, which I played on my now-ancient gameboy color. I happily played that game everyday. One day, my friend showed me the "old man glitch" and I had my first encounter with the notorious Pokemon missingno. It fascinated me, and confused me. After my imagination ran dry, I finally tried to figure out the mystery behind missingno online. I stumbled into a world of "bits" and "variables" and "pointers." I was in the world of programming, and it was then that found my love for computers.</p>

			<p>Ever since, I have spent much of my time learning about computers and electronics. I built my first computer as a young teenager, where I installed Ubuntu and got my first taste of Linux. In high school, I learned my first programming language, Java... and now it feels like a second language to me. I have developed a passion for problem solving techniques and understand how technology can interact with it.</p>

			<p>In 2014, I began my collegiate career at Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), where I have declared to study Computer Science. I am currently a senior working on my BS, with a minor in Mathematics. In 2018, I plan to enter graduate school to earn my MS in Applied Computer Science.</p>

			<p>Computer science offers a wide variety of disciplines; I am mostly interested in networking, cryptography, bitcoin and the evolving crypto-economy, algorithm design, and artificial intelligence. In general, I am interested in the ways we can apply technology to contemporary problems in order to solve them.</p>

			<p>Outside of the tech world, I love the great outdoors. I have hiked in some of the most beautiful places in the US, and hope to explore international land in the future. One of my favorite hobbies is golfing. I am a 15 handicap, but to me, it's all about the fun of hitting a ball into the wide open.</p>
