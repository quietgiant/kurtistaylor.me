				about me
			</h3>
			<p>I was born in 1995 in Kalamazoo, Michigan and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1997 where I have lived ever since. Growing up, I played basketball and baseball. I also loved to play all sorts of video games, just like I do now. One of my favorites was Pokemon Blue, which I played on my now-ancient Gameboy Color. One day, my friend showed me the "old man glitch" and I had my first encounter with the most notorious Pokemon from that series - Missingno. Curious, I stumbled into a world of "bits" and "variables" and "pointers" when searching for answers online. I was in the world of programming for the first time.</p><br>
			<p>Ever since, I have spent much of my time learning about computers and electronics. I built my first computer as a young teenager, where I installed Ubuntu and got my first taste of Linux. In high school, I learned my first programming language, Java... although now-a-days I prefer C#. I have developed a passion for problem solving techniques and understand how technology can interact with it.</p><br>
			<p>In 2014, I began studying Computer Science at <a href="https://www.pfw.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW)</a>. I decided to pursue a graduate degree and began studying Applied Computer Science at PFW in 2018. I graduated with a Masters of Science in Applied Computer Science in 2020.</p><br>
			<p>Computer science offers a wide variety of disciplines; I am mostly interested in web applications (especially progressive), computational finance tools, algorithmic trading bots, and distributed systems. In general, I am interested in the ways we can apply technology to contemporary problems in order to solve them.</p><br>
			<p>I began working as an intern at <a href="https://www.apterainc.com/" target="_blank">Aptera Software</a> in January 2018 and went full-time in May 2018. Aptera is a great place to work where I get many opportunities to solve unique challenges with fantastic teams. Plus, we're a Microsoft shop and I get to use the .NET stack everyday. üòÅ</p><br/>
			<p>Outside of the tech world, I love to cook. <a href="http://www.thebbqguru.net/" target="_blank">I think I got it from my dad!</a> I also love the great outdoors. I have hiked in some of the most beautiful places in the US, and hope to explore more of the world in the future. Another of my favorite ways to spend free time is golfing. I am a 14 handicap and try ti play at least once a week.</p><br>
